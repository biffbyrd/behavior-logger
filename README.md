# Event Recorder
This is a Java 8 project. To get up and running with Java 8 and Java FX:

- [Environment Setup](https://trello.com/c/MDSEnFGh/88-setting-up-your-programming-environment) - Trello card giving steps to setting up the project, Java 8, Java FX, and Eclipse.
- [scratch package](https://github.com/biffbyrd/event-recorder/tree/master/src/com/threebird/scratch) - where I put examples while learning these tools.
