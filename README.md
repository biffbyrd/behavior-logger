# About
Behavior Logger is a data collection tool for applied behavior analysis. I designed the interface for practitioners conducting treatment while one or more data-collectors record behaviors.

I am currently working with WVU's [Dr. St. Peter and her lab](http://psychology.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/claire-st-peter) to improve the user experience. Her lab is already actively using the application for several research projects.
