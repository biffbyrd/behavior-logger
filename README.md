# Event Recorder
This is a Java 8 project. To get up and running with Java 8 and Java FX:

- [Environment Setup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A7WIhlN8fBmiSpRusua9_yXuhKxYCR0jw-FPIbSAmH0/edit) - google doc giving steps to setting up Java 8 with Java FX.
- [scratch package](https://github.com/biffbyrd/event-recorder/tree/master/src/com/threebird/scratch) - where I put examples while learning these tools.
